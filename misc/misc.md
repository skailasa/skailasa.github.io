friend's blog covering mostly Software Engineering stuff, and his personal 
projects.
- [[jp-konig/economics-finance]](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com) - Monetary 
economics, but touches on all sorts of things in finance and econ. Great even 
with a limited knowledge base in these fields.
- [[scott-aaronson/physics-computer-science]](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/) 
- Scott is a Theoretical Computer Scientist, focusing on quantum 
information. I've been sporadically reading this blog since I was a student 
interested in the field. Though a little advanced for me now.
- [[various/software-computer-science]](http://www.drdobbs.com) - Dr Dobbs 
archive. Basically an old software periodical that's now out of print. Full of 
great stuff.
- [[martin-fowler/software]](https://martinfowler.com/) - An absolute legend of 
software engineering, goes through loads of concepts in some great blog posts. I 
found this blog by looking for info on

## Books [title/year/author/topic]

- [[zero-to-one/2014/thiel/startups]](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) - 
Succint overview of what it takes to launch a succesful IT business.
Meanders into futurism towards the end, and speculation about the kind of 
personality it takes to run a business. 3/5.
- [[bad blood:.../2018/carreyrou/startups]]() - Story, written like a novel, of 
Theranos, and how far bullshit could take you in Silicon Valley at it's height. 
Really interesting, even if a little sensationalist. 4/5.
- [[billionaire raj:.../2018/crabtree/current-affairs]](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1786073803) - 
Overview of India's new gilded age, marked by new levels of inequality and 
cronyism. Very easy and thought provoking read. For me it raised all sort of
questions about how economic progress is measured, and what meaningful metrics
of progress are. 4/5.
- [[winners take all:.../2018/giridharadas/current-affairs]](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Winners-Take-All-Charade-Changing/dp/0241400724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548866851&sr=8-1&keywords=anand+giridharadas") -
Properly refreshing view of elite posturing in the face of the need for genuine 
and systemic change. 5/5.
- [[utopia for realists/bregman/2017/new-thinking]](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Utopia-Realists-How-Can-There/dp/1408890267) -
Short and insightful book about some interesting ideas that might be necessary.
Think of no border controls, and universal basic income. 3/5.

## Films [name/director/year]
- [[one cut of the dead/ueda/2017]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Cut_of_the_Dead) -
Not usually one to watch zombie films, but really hilarious and original
take on a classic genre, begins with a 37 single take, with minor details
turning out to be the basis of hilarious scenes well into the film. 4/5.
- [[vice/mckay/2018]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(2018_film)) - 
Biopic of someone I personally knew very little about, Dick Cheney, VP during
the Bush administration. Interesting, and from the same guy who did the Big
Short. Though provoking but almost certainly simplifying, it was pretty
entertaining though. 3/5.
