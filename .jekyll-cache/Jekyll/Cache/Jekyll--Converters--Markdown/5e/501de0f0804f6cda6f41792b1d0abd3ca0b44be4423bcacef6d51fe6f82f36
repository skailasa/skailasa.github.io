I"õ<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a Masterâ€™s student at UCL, studying Scientific Computing,
foolishly aiming to a Ph.D in the near future. Since finishing undergrad
Iâ€™ve been working in various startups in and around London.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in all things mathematical, and computational. At the
moment I am focused on improving my computer science and software
engineering basics. You can follow my practice on
