I"V<p>A storm is raging outside in London, and the world is on the brink of 
a Coronavirus pandemic, but have you always wanted to know just what a Y
Combinator was didn’t you? The phrase has been popularised by the startup
school of the same name, and there’s actually some very interesting mathematics
behind it.</p>

<h2 id="1-what-is-it-for">1) What is it for?</h2>

<p>It helps to define recursive functions in the lambda calculus.
Let’s break that down. Recursion is the cornerstone of control flow in the
functional style of programming. However, it’s not possible to define recursive
functions in the lambda calculus. The lambda calculus is just a set of simple
rules that underpin functional programming, that allows one to express 
arbitrary computations in terms of the application of functions to inputs and
get outputs, it’s so simple that it doesn’t make space for recursive
functions.</p>

<h2 id="2-lightspeed-lambda-calculus">2) Lightspeed Lambda Calculus.</h2>

<p>The lambda abstraction allows you to express an anonymous function in the lambda
calculus, and will be very familiar with Python programmers who’ve used Python’s
anonymous functions.</p>

<p>Consider the increment function written using Python lambdas,</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And an equivalent definition using the lambda calculus (with a dyadic addition
operator).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda x . x + 1</script>

<p>You can see the obvious resemblence. The variable ‘x’ is bound to the function
in the sense that it’s not making reference to an ‘x’ defined elsewhere in your
lambda expression, (or your code if you were programming).</p>

<h2 id="2-reduction-in-the-lambda-calculus">2) Reduction in the lambda calculus</h2>

<p>Just like in other forms of calculus (in my definition, justmethods of calculating things) we need
some way of simplfying expressions we write down. The lambda calculus defines 3 basic ways of doing this, and they are called ‘reduction’ methods.</p>

<p>$\alpha$ reduction basically says that you can rename variables, and your 
lambda expressions’ meaning remains unchanged.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda x. x \rightarrow \lambda y. y</script>

<p>$\beta$ reduction says that when you apply your lambda abstraction to an
expression, all free instances in your abstraction’s expression of the abstraction’s parameter are replaced with the new expression. That’s kind of
a mouthful, but it’s easy to see visually.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\lambda x. x + 1) \> 4 \rightarrow 4+1 = 5</script>

<p>This looks a lot like (and in fact is) like currying a function for
partial application. The instances of ‘x’ in the lambda abstraction’s expression (x+1) are replaced with 4.</p>

<p>Finally there’s $\eta$ reduction. Which states that when there are no bound
instances of the lambda abstraction’s parameter in it’s expression and it’s
expression is a function, the following identity holds,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda x. F \rightarrow F</script>

<h2 id="4-the-y-combinator">4) The Y Combinator</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, that’s enough to at least see where the Y Combinator comes
from, if not understand it particularly deeply. Our lambda calculus helps us
write functions in terms of inputs and outputs, and we also have a way to
simplify (reduce) complex lambda abstractions, into simpler ones (normalise).</p>

<p>But in functional programming we face a problem, which is that control flow
is often defined by recursion, and we’ve no way to account for this using the
simple tools above.</p>

<p>Consider this function written recursively to find factorials,</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">FAC</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">FAC</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The lambda expression for this is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{FAC} = (\lambda n. \text{if} \> (= \> n \> 0) \> 1 \> (* \> n \> (\text{FAC} (- \> n \> 1))))</script>

<p>This admittedly is a little more complicated than the examples above. But by
noting that the arithmetic operators (+/=/* etc) are partially applied to two
arguments, it should be possible to read that it’s doing the same operation
as the python code above.</p>

<p>Let’s simplify this by writing it as,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{FAC} = \lambda n. (...\text{FAC}...)</script>

<p>We can do a reverse $\beta$ reduction (known as a $\beta$ ‘abstraction’ - confusingly) on this to get,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{FAC} = (\lambda \text{fac}. \>  (\lambda n. \> (...\text{fac}...))) \text{FAC}</script>

<p>which you can verify. Why does this help, this loooks worse! However, we can
now see that the above expression is of the form,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{FAC} = \text{H} \> \text{FAC}</script>

<p>Where $\text{H}$ is some function, and if we feed the input $\text{FAC}$ into
this function we return $\text{FAC}$. Compare with ordinary algebra, this is like feeding 0 into the function f(x) = x. In mathematics, this is known as a
fixed point.</p>

<p>So we now know that the $\text{FAC}$ function must be a fixed point of $\text{H}$ whatever it is. So we now are looking for a fixed point of $\text{H}$ in
order to write our algorithm in the lambda calculus. We don’t know how to do
this, but let’s pretend that we do. Let’s invent a function $\text{Y}$ that
takes any other function, and returns its fixed point. This allows us to write
the following expression,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{Y \> H} = \text{H(Y \> H)}</script>
