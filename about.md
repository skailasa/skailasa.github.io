# About

I'm a graduate student at University College London. My research interests span
scientific computing, and applied mathematics. Specifically I am working on
high-performance distributed codes for integral equations, running on the latest
heterogenous computing hardware.

I'm interested in all aspects of computing, and I find the idea of a general purpose machine fascinating.

This blog is mainly about my interest in computers and/or maths. I'm also interested
in other things. Mainly, music, film/tv, cycling and keeping fit in general.
