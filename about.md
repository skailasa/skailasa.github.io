# About

I'm currently a Master's student at UCL, studying Scientific Computing,
foolishly aiming to a Ph.D in the near future. Since finishing undergrad
I've been working in various startups in and around London.

I'm interested in all things mathematical, and computational. At the
moment I am focused on improving my computer science and software
engineering basics. You can follow my practice on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/skailasa/practice/).
