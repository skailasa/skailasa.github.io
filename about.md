# About

I'm a graduate student at University College London. My research interests span
scientific computing, and applied mathematics. Specifically I am working on
high-performance distributed codes for integral equations, running on the latest
heterogenous computing hardware. 

Personally, I'm just generally interested in all aspects of computing.
I find the idea of a general purpose machine fascinating, especially the complexity 
that emerges from a single set of electronic components. Previously I studied physics,
it wasn't quite for me. But, idea of being able to mathematically describe the world
, often analytically, stuck with me. 

This blog is mainly about my interest in computers and/or maths. I'm also interested
in other things. Mainly, music, film/tv, cycling and keeping fit in general.
