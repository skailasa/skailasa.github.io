I"¥Š<p>Just as there are atomic <a href="2018/12/05/sorting-algorithms.html">algorithms</a>
there are also atomic data strutures. These essentially amount to different
objects to store data in, each object following a conveniently designed
protocol. In this post Iâ€™m going to go through the most common ones that
every coder should just sort of know. Namely: <strong>linked lists</strong>, <strong>hash tables</strong>,
<strong>stacks</strong>, <strong>queues</strong> and <strong>r rooted trees</strong>.</p>

<p>This may sound like a lot for a single post, but as weâ€™ll see, a lot of 
the protocols kind of boil do to a single use case - storing data, and 
accessing it conveniently in order to <em>implement</em> different algorithms. 
Implementation of algorithms is key here, the design of data structures 
is intrinsically interesting from a maths perspective, but their design is
heavily influenced by the problems you can solve by using them.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous post on <a href="2018/12/05/sorting-algorithms.html">algorithms</a>
Iâ€™m going to go through the above data structures one by one, and write a
simple Python implementation of the protocol. Furthermore, as a Python
programmer Iâ€™m also going to write a little bit about how Python implements 
these data structures as language <em>primitives</em> (i.e. for free!) as it 
doesnâ€™t necessarily strictly adhere to the above protocols as described 
in CS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">textbooks</a>
but they do offer some convenient extras that are special to the language.
My aim here is simply to make visible all the moving parts.</p>

<h2 id="stacks-and-queues">Stacks and Queues</h2>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stacks and queues are well named, and would behave as you would expect
for such objects. Stacks operate under â€˜Last In First Outâ€™ (LIFO), 
like a stack of plates - you would get to the bottom plate by first 
removing the plates on top of it. Whereas queues operate under â€˜First In
First Outâ€™ (FIFO), much like standing in a (well functioning) queue.</p>

<p>Below Iâ€™ve implemented a stack object using the Python list. Stacks
implement two methods to add (push) and delete (pop) data. The pop method
usually doensâ€™t accept any arguments as Stacks by their nature follow LIFO.</p>

<p>Python doesnâ€™t offer stack primitives, but they do encourage the use of
Python lists as stacks, as you can perform operations in a LIFO manner:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="c1"># pop from top of stack
</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># lists are truthy, so can check if empty:

</span><span class="ow">not</span> <span class="p">[]</span>  <span class="c1"># True
</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="queues">Queues</h3>

<p>Again, Python doesnâ€™t offer a primitive queue object, so Iâ€™ve implemented
the basic protocol below using a list. Additionally, the delete and insert
operations are called dequeue and enqueue by convention for queues.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Queue</span><span class="p">:</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although Python doesnâ€™t offer queue or stack primitives, it does offer a
built-in implementation for FIFO/LIFO objects through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Queue</code> module 
that ships with the standard library that fulfill both the simple 
protocols above, with some extras. It would in general be wise to use this
rather than implement your own, as they will have taken care to optimise
the performance of the objects in comparison to the ones Iâ€™ve implemented
above.</p>

<p>What kind of problems can we use this technology for? Pretty much anything
where you want to access data in a consistent way, for</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>Stacks and Queues operations to insert and delete data are both $O(1)$. 
This latter statement is a result of the fact that data access occurs in 
a pre-defined manner (LIFO/FIFO). Therefore, when implementing an algorithm
that relies on data access in some pre-defined manner, one should attempt
to use a stack/queue. For example I made use of a queue to implement 
<a href="2018/12/05/sorting-algorithms.html">breadth first search</a>,
where I needed to store the next nodes to consider in order of consideration.</p>

<h2 id="linked-lists-dynamic-arrays">Linked Lists (Dynamic Arrays)</h2>

<p>In most low level programming languages, you have to declare how much 
<em>stuff</em> can go in an array before putting in anything in by setting aside
some memory when you create an array object. In doing this though, you
quickly run into problems. Imagine you create an algorithm to process 
the results of some mathematical calculation, each time you get a result
you add it to an array, however setting your calculation off you quickly
eat up all the memory youâ€™ve allocated to your initial array, and you 
have to create a new array object as a part of your algorithm. This could
quickly get messy, with references to new arrays being created dynamically.
(Singly) Linked Lists, or Dynamic Arrays, get around this problem by allowing you
to extend arrays as you go. One does so by modelling each datum in the 
array as being stored in a node, with pointer to the next datum.</p>

<p>This model is pretty good, though it is a little fiddly to deal with 
inserting and deleting data, the basic methods for a linked list, which
Iâ€™ve implemented below, are again to do with the insertion and removal of
data.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but luckily you probably wonâ€™t have to ever
fiddle around with a similar implementation of your own, as Python has
you covered with the ever helpful list. Python lists amount to dynamic
arrays which you can (within reason) keep appending data to. They
are fantastic, versatile objects, with many more features than my little
Linked List above. Specifically, my <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove</code> method fails to account for
nodes with duplicate data, and my <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert</code> method canâ€™t place a node
anywhere but at the head of the linked list. Python lists allow you to 
place items in a list by index, which is much more versatile than the
above - which is the basic protocol for (singly) linked lists.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h3>

<p>Linked lists are â€˜linearâ€™, i.e. the way to search through them happens
linearly - one node at a time. Therefore we can reason that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">search</code>
method, and therefore the <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove</code> method are both $O(N)$, whereas the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">insert</code> method is much cheaper as we always insert at the head of the
list, and is $O(1)$. Therefore, these data structures are more useful when
our algorithm needs to store data much more often than it needs to look
it up.</p>

<h2 id="rooted-trees">Rooted Trees</h2>

<p>We can use a similar node-pointer model to represent rooted trees,
in the context of this post weâ€™ll only consider <strong>binary trees</strong>
and <strong>binary search trees</strong>. As with linked lists, weâ€™ll assume each node
contains some data, the remaining attributes are the pointers to the other
nodes, which will inevitable vary with the type of rooted tree.</p>

<h3 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h3>

<p>The nodes of binary trees can only point at most to two other nodes,
hence <strong>binary</strong>. We refer to nodes, and the ones they point to as 
â€˜parentsâ€™ and â€˜childrenâ€™, respectively,
In terms of implementation, itâ€™s a fairly common pattern Iâ€™ve seen
<a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html">elsewhere</a> to specify
binary (search) trees in an abstract manner. Using just a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Node</code>
object, with pointers to a given nodeâ€™s parent, and two children.</p>

<p>In terms of manipulating this structure to view/insert/delete data we
can implement common tree-traversal methods. Below, Iâ€™ve implemented a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">lookup</code> method to find a given node in binary (search) tree using in-order
traversal:</p>

<h3 id="binary-search-trees">Binary Search Trees</h3>

<p>Binary search trees have the additional property that all child nodes to
the left of a given node contain data in of smaller or equal value to the
datum in that node, and all nodes to itâ€™s right contain data of greater
value. For integers this is obvious, but less so for things like strings.
Where you may have to map the data youâ€™re storing back to unique integers
in order to store it. Using this we can write a simple method to insert
data into Binary Search Trees.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve used a similar recursive strategy to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">lookup</code>
above. This is because recursion pops out fairly naturally when manipulating
trees, mostly beacuse weâ€™ll want to consider each node of a tree in a
linear manner, often based on a condition, but the data structure is 
itself clearly non-linear.</p>

<p>Python doesnâ€™t offer any tree primitives, so are they really that useful?
I think a lot people understimate the importance of trees. Famously the
author of <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">Homebrew</a>
complained about being rejected from Google for â€˜failing to invert a 
binary treeâ€™, which he thought was BS as he had created software that 
pretty much all Mac coders use. Initially I was inclined to side with him,
but I read this 
<a href="https://thecodebarbarian.com/i-dont-want-to-hire-you-if-you-cant-reverse-a-binary-tree">blog post</a> 
that really changed my mind on the issue.</p>

<p>So why doesnâ€™t Python implement tree primitives despite them being so
important in Computer Science? The truth is it does, a more complex abstraction
such as a Python dictionary, or a JSON object is built on top of a tree like
structure. In terms of raw trees, much like my implementation of a linked
list earlier, Pythonâ€™s creators probably thought it was more useful in 
terms of solving problems to wrap the basic abstraction inside a higher
level concept, which when you think about it is. Do you really want to
implement a tree traversal method, every time you want to look up an item
in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">dict</code> like structure?</p>

<h3 id="analysis-2">Analysis</h3>

<p>My recursive tree methods above go through each node, one by one,
operating on a constructed tree in-place. Therefore, they are of $O(1)$
in space, and of $O(log(N))$ in time. This comes from the number of levels
in a binary tree, which can be found by using a similar argument to that
of <a href="2018/12/05/sorting-algorithms.html">merge sort</a>. But as a binary tree
could degenerate into a linked-list, this time complexity in the worst
case would be $O(N)$.</p>

<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h2>

<p>Hash tables are the most effective way of representing an abstratction
for <code class="highlighter-rouge">dictionary</code> like objects. i.e. where we want to read, update, and
insert data by reference to some name. In theory names (or hashes) are
difficult to create uniquely (search for hash collisions), but in practice
most hashing algorithms are sound enough to make collisions very rare indeed.
This lookup can be very efficient, $O(1)$, as long as we can guarantee
unique hashes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve built a fairly contrived implementation below, using Python lists
as the underlying data structure. Iâ€™ve used lists to handle potential
hash collision, i.e. if a hash for a particular value corresponds to
a hash for some other value, by using a list to store values you can
handle collisions.</p>

<p>In reality you would never bother implementing the above code in Python
as dictionaries are primitives in the language, and in many other languages
both interpreted and compiled.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-3">Analysis</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re hashing algorithm is decent, you should be able to perform
lookups/inserts in $O(1)$ on average.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Data structures are a very deep topic, and Iâ€™ve scratched the surface
here with simple implementations, of fairly simple data structures. For
example, the hash table Iâ€™ve implemented is one in which Iâ€™ve not optimised
the hash function to reduce collisions, or considered really the type of
problem Iâ€™d wish to solve (and hence the underlying data structure it
should rely on). However, itâ€™s a good start for anyone interesting in
studying the topic, and CLRS is really the place to supplemement this
post.</p>
