I"Ž<p>Since leaving my job and resuming student life Iâ€™ve once again come face to face with something that Iâ€™d completely forgotten about, procrastination. Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s plagued me over the years, and Iâ€™ve struggled to deal with repeatedly. Having been working or interning for 18 months I had forgotten that this was a thing that I used to do! When I was working I was always so tired that I never had the time to really procrastinate. I was either at work, commuting, cooking, going out, exercising or sleeping. If I wasnâ€™t doing anything I never thought I was procrastinating, I thought of myself as having a break.</p>

<p>Looking back on recent years, I remember entire weeks leading up to big school or university exams where I would always find an excuse for not having the perfect conditions to revise in. There was always a slight bit of tiredeness, or flu, or stress to keep me from working. There was a place I just had to be at an awkward time, a book I just had to finish, or the last 4 episodes of a TV series which needed to be watched.  This was just a tool to avoid the issue at hand, avoid the thought of an exam, avoid the thought of potential failure.</p>

<p>This week marks the start of my reading week, but also the first full week where Iâ€™m not working at my old job. I woke up with the intent of finishing all of my uni work, so that I would have the rest of the week to work on my upcoming internship and job interviews. At 11 AM things were going approximately to plan, I was reading some notes from last week - and it hit me, a rejection email from an internship I had done the coding test for last week. Wham, and like that my whole day was derailed.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t help but then waste time scrutinising something that was already gone, the details of the rejection, trying to figure out why my submission failed despite answering the question. I already knew the reason for this is because a lot of these things are subjective, from past experience, but this didnâ€™t stop me wasting my day. In fact I full flexed into this, and in the end nothing got done.</p>

<p>I think these issues generalise beyond me. Thereâ€™s a subset of us out there, whoâ€™ve spent their whole lives defining their self worth through essentially trying to prove how smart they are to everyone else, taking every minor failure as a personal flaw, and using this as their motivation. This is incredibly unhealthy, but from offhand conversations with various friends and acquantainces this problem is fairly widespread.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s probably due to the culture in which some of us are raised in, especially immigrant communities, where it sometimes feels like thereâ€™s one opportunity that other people already struggled to provide for you, you definitely donâ€™t want to waste it. But, Iâ€™m cynical. I think that it comes from something else, itâ€™s definitely more of an inner feeling. Itâ€™s a feeling of a loss on an investment. One feels like theyâ€™ve invested so much of themselves into achieving some pretty much arbitrarily defined notion of success, when they donâ€™t succeed on their necessarily narrow criteria (necassarily - as one canâ€™t possibly know all variables or the future), they attribute it to their personal failing.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think that the recruitment process, or culture of the technology industry does much to discourage this though. The perpetuation of the child-prodigy meme, i.e. one who effortlessly picks up and dismisses every concept they come across, who swims through life getting everything they set their mind to, masks the hard work that goes on in the lives of many people.</p>

<p>In the global scale of suffering and this seems like a minor issue. However, I think with a widening conversation about mental health - perfectionism, or anxiety about oneâ€™s performance, must definitely be taken seriously. Iâ€™ve found that I personally am susceptible to it, and must be thousands of others.</p>
