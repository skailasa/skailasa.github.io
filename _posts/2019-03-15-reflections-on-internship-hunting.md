title: "Reflections on Internship Hunting"
date: 2019-03-15

It's been a while since I've made a post, technical or otherwise, and it been
largely due to the amount of stuff going on! Ever since quitting my last job
almost 5 months ago now, I've been on familiar path, that of the 'cracking the
coding interview', looking for an internship to tide me over whilst I finish my
master's. I've had jobs and internships before, but this would be the first time
that I was applying to software developer positions explicitly (in my last role
I was promoted internally to that position). What can I say, it was a huge bundle
of stress for the most part, and I'm only in a position to reflect on the
experience now, having been offered a position for summer 2019. If anyone is
treading, or planning to tread, along this path in the near future, hopefully
this post will offer some solace on this fairly solitary journey. 


### 1. Prepare to work really hard

Constant failure, and rejection, seem to be a part of this experience, which is
based on numbers more than anything else. I applied to maybe 30 companies, this
translated into 15 phone screens, 9 code interviews, 4 phone interviews, 
2 onsite interviews and a solitary offer. Bear in mind, this was just for an 
internship. Considering the time spent studying, and working on applications, 
never mind attending all the interviews (which could last up to 5 hours, 
excluding travel), I probably spent a good 200-250 hours working on this.


### 2. Double down

I have never felt lower at times, being told to your face that you're simply not
smart enough, repeatedly, is exhausting, and frustrating. Especially when a lot
of tech interviews are down to whether or not you've seen some puzzle before, and
if you have then you'll ace it. This was my least favourite aspect, but it is
a feature of this space. Especially if you make it later stages. The lesson I
learned is you've got to double down, even if you feel like you're not getting
anywhere, keep applying.


### 3. 'Congrats for making it to the next stage!....'

There are so many stages to these things, and sometimes - even after investing
maybe a month or so in a process, prepare to get abandoned - with no feedback
nada. This actually happened to me twice. I had collectively 4 interviews over
the course of 2 months with a company, 2 code interviews, 1 maths interview,
1 general interview, and 5 hours on-site. I was told everything was going great,
and that I'd hear back in the next few days - radio silence, no response to
emails or phone-calls, it was awful, especially considering the time I'd already
invested in this company. Despite the media reiterating the lucrative nature of
tech jobs, it's somehow also a super-saturated market, especially at the higher
end, where there're always better/faster/smarter/more well connected people. The
number of stages, meant to make the process objective and egalitarian, are actually
somewhat counterproductive in the sense that the best prepared/connected have to
try less hard for each stage, meaning that the poeple who were always gonna get
it do so anyway.

### 4. You can prepare for them 

Everyone wants to work at one of the Big "N" (fb, appl, googl, msft, amzn), one
of the massive internet companies. However, these guys only hire the 'best', but
this is something you *can* prepare and study for. I think working in an early
stage startup meant that I wasn't exposed to the highly competitive world of
hackerrank, leetcode, etc, where you have to whip out a functioning implementation
of some random algorithm in a couple of minutes. But, like with other tests, you
can study - and I have gotten better with practice, but it takes time. When you
see those folks at the big tech companies, you better believe that they studied,
hard, to get there.

### 5. You can feel spread very thin

Everyone is looking for a different skill set, as a junior person you don't
really have any domain expertise, so you kind of have to know a little bit
about everything, this can get frustrating. Imagine studying sorting algorithms 
for 2 weeks, only to be asked about networking for 2 hours in an interview - 
something you know nothing about, but might be closely related to the job. This 
is definitely the interviewer's fault, but the problem is you have to take this
as a given - it will happen, maybe more than once.


I guess in making the above list I just wanted to highlight how common all of
these experiences are. If anything, the past 4 months - though draining - have
been a great experience in learning how this whole thing seems to work anyways.
