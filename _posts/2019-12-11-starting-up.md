I haven't posted recently because I've been so busy, I'm currently working as a research assistant at UCL, in addition to my degree, and attending UCL's Launch10k accellerator program! I'm really excited about the latter, but it's sucking up a lot of my free time, though I'm learning a lot. Coming from a purely tech background, it's been fun to get stuck into the product management side of things. Refining our initial idea (still top secret lol), and trying to conduct some market resarch to see if anyone even really wants it! So far it's been going well, testing out the pitch on people who are clued up on the tech, all the way down to lay-people like my parents, it's been fairly convincing - a lot of people are wondering why something like this doesn't already exist... But it has been a lot of work to develop the demo, the pitches, the decks and the branding - but hopefully it should be worth it soon. Maybe I'll even have Â£10k to show for it if nothing else.

Regular post about something computer based soon.
